Utility program to code new content for Zoo Tycoon 2, similar to the official Animal Project Editor for Zoo Tycoon 1.
Now with a few tweaks here and there, due to the program being last edited in 2018

### Installation
You need to have installed:
- python 3.7 (make sure you add it to your system path during installation, originally was 3.6 however it errors out now)
- requests
- bs4 (beautifulsoup4)

You may need to downgrade urlib3 (Check the error codes you get while opening with Python via "Open with IDLE" when right clicking file APE2.py)
- Do this with "pip install urllib3==1.26.6"

Install the missing dependencies with python's package manager, `pip` (eg. in the Windows commandline, type `pip install requests`).

Click the `Clone or Download` button at the right, then `Download ZIP`. Unzip to a folder of your choice. Assuming you have python configured as an environment variable, run the program by double clicking on `run.bat` (a shortcut for typing `python ape2.py` in a console window.
